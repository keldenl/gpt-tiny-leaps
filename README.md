# gpt-tiny-leaps
Tiny proof of concept python apps that use OpenAI's GPT library.

## Local LLM
You can very easily use all these scripts with local LLMs like llama/redpajama/dolly. Just head over to my other project [https://github.com/keldenl/gpt-llama.cpp](https://github.com/keldenl/gpt-llama.cpp) to get set up â€“ it allows for any gpt-powered apps to run off local LLMs.
